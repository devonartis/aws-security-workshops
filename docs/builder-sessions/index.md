                <td align="left">In this hands-on builder session, we help you identify which cloud-native solutions can mitigate the same risks while providing scalability, reliability, and cost optimization at a low operational burden. During this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.

                <td align="left">Permission boundaries is probably one of the most important new IAM feature that has launched in awhile. This feature addresses a longstanding customer issue, namely, how do I delegate administration to my users. If you have developers that need to be able to create roles for Lambda functions, system administrators that need to be able to create IAM roles and users, or any similar scenario, then you need permission boundaries.

                <td align="left">This Secrets Manager Builder Session guides you through the use of AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS and AWS Fargate. In the first phase of the Builder Session, you will access the RDS data base with Secrets Manager. You will then use Secrets Manager to rotate the data base password. You will then use Secrets Manager to access the data base again to show that you can continue to access the data base after the rotation.</br></br> 
                In the second phase of the Builder Session, you will extend your use of Secrets Manager into an AWS Fargate container. You will create an Amazon ECS task definition to pass secrets to the Fargate container and then launch the Fargate container. You will then SSH into the container to show that the secret was passed to the container and that you can access the RDS data base.
