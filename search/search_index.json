You'll be working with services such as AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, Amazon EC2 Instance Connect, and AWS Identity and Access Management. You will learn how to use these services to securely connect and administer your Amazon EC2 Instances as well as systems on-premises, you will setup tagged based access, and configure logging which will enable auditing of administrative activities and improve the security posture of your environment. Welcome to the AWS security workshops portal! Here you will find a collection of workshops and other hands-on content aimed at helping you gain an understanding of the AWS service ecosystem and introduce you to a variety of best practices that can be applied to securing your environments and workloads running in AWS. Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure which runs all of the services offered and this responsibility is known as the Security of the Cloud . AWS customers benefit from a data center and network architecture built to satisfy the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. Customers responsibility, known as the Security in the Cloud , is determined by which services the customer chooses to use. The workshops and other hands-on content contained in this portal are focused on the Security in the Cloud and they will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks you'll face in building securely on AWS. They will also highlight the design principals from the AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar , which can help you improve your security posture. Finally, in order to help you take a more holistic approach to security on AWS, we divide a lot of the content up into categories aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework Core Functions to help you understand the scope of the content.

The scenario simulates an attack that spans a few threat vectors, representing just a small sample of the threats that GuardDuty is able to detect. In addition, you will look at how to view and analyze GuardDuty findings, how to send alerts based on the findings, and, finally, how to remediate findings. Level : Intermediate Duration : 1 hour NIST CSF Functions : Protect, Detect, Respond CAF Components : Preventative, Detective, Responsive Services : Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Lambda, Security Groups, Amazon SNS Mitigate Risks Using Cloud-Native Infrastructure Security In this hands-on builder session, we help you identify which cloud-native solutions can mitigate the same risks while providing scalability, reliability, and cost optimization at a low operational burden. During this workshop, you will learn how to use cloud native controls like CloudTrail, Security Groups, GuardDuty and many more, to secure your cloud architecture.

This feature addresses a longstanding customer issue, namely, how do I delegate administration to my users. If you have developers that need to be able to create roles for Lambda functions, system administrators that need to be able to create IAM roles and users, or any similar scenario, then you need permission boundaries. Level : Intermediate Duration : 1 hour Services : AWS IAM Permission Boundaries Focus : Delegated Administration Using AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS and AWS Fargate This Secrets Manager Builder Session guides you through the use of AWS Secrets Manager with Amazon RDS and AWS Fargate. In the first phase of the Builder Session, you will access the RDS data base with Secrets Manager. You will then use Secrets Manager to rotate the data base password. You will then use Secrets Manager to access the data base again to show that you can continue to access the data base after the rotation. In the second phase of the Builder Session, you will extend your use of Secrets Manager into an AWS Fargate container. You will create an Amazon ECS task definition to pass secrets to the Fargate container and then launch the Fargate container. You will then SSH into the container to show that the secret was passed to the container and that you can access the RDS data base.

This workshop is broken into two sections. The first section will guide you through a demonstration of the features and functions of Security Hub. The second section will show you how to use Security Hub to import findings from different data sources, analyze findings so you can prioritize response work, and implement responses to findings to help improve your security posture. Level : 300 Duration : 2 - 3 hours NIST CSF Functions : Detect and Respond CAF Components : Detective, Responsive Personas : Incident responders, Security analysts and Security operations engineers Scaling threat detection and response on AWS This hands-on workshop is where you will learn about a number of AWS services involved with threat detection and response as we walk through real-world threat scenarios. Learn about the threat detection capabilities of Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie and AWS Security Hub and the available response options. For each hands-on scenario, we review methods to detect and respond to threats using the following services: AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC flow logs, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon Macie, AWS Lambda, Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Security Hub.
